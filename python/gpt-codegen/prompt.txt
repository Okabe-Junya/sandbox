Automatically generate a congestion control algorithm\n\n I will present you with a congestion control algorithm written in Python, and you improve the algorithm. Then return the improved Python code. The generated function should take (ssthresh, cwnd, segment size, rtt) as arguments and (new_cwnd, new_ssthresh) as return value. All arguments and return values must be of type int. The function name should be 'congestion_control'. The first function is shown as an example.\n\n
